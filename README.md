# My-EDAs

Welcome to **My-EDAs**! This repository is a collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects on a variety of datasets. Each EDA is organized in its own folder, containing notebooks, datasets, and reports that document the data exploration, visualization, and key findings.

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a separate EDA project. Inside each project folder, you will typically find:

- **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)**: The main code for data exploration and visualization.
- **Raw Datasets (`.csv` or similar)**: The data files used for analysis.
- **Reports (`.pdf`, `.md`)**: Summaries of findings and insights from the EDA.

Example structure:
```text

│ ├── main.ipynb
│ ├── hepatitis.csv
│ └── final_report.pdf
│
├── [Other EDA Project]/
